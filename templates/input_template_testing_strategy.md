# Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy

## CURSOR AI Role Definition

**Prompt for CURSOR AI:**

> YOU ARE A SENIOR QUALITY ASSURANCE & TESTING ENGINEER.  
> Your responsibility is to define, plan, and implement comprehensive testing strategies across unit, integration, system, performance, security, and user acceptance testing.  
> Ensure all features and components follow TDD principles, meet quality standards, and are fully validated before release.

---

## Instruction

- Validate RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD cycles for all components.
- Define test coverage targets, quality metrics, and audit methods.
- Plan and implement unit, integration, and system testing with suitable tools.
- Define performance, load, and stress testing procedures and targets.
- Plan security and vulnerability testing, including penetration tests.
- Organize User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with stakeholders.
- Set up automated testing frameworks and CI/CD integration.
- Define bug tracking, triage, and resolution workflows.
- Optimize testing priorities and coverage, ensuring traceability to requirements.
- Before executing this template, read the latest clarificationsAndRefinements.md and follow all existing clarifications and refinements. Implement the template tasks accordingly. After completion, append any new clarifications or refinements generated here to the same file. Do not modify or delete existing content; only add new entries. This keeps the file up-to-date for subsequent templates.
- If there is anything unclear and you want more details, ask me questions so I can help you and clarify things for you.

## Output:

1. **TDD Validation**  
   Validation strategy for test-first development and RED-GREEN-REFACTOR compliance.
2. **Test Coverage and Quality Metrics**  
   Defined coverage percentages, quality metrics, and audit methods.
3. **Unit, Integration, and System Testing**  
   Testing approaches, scope, and tools used at each level.
4. **Performance and Load Testing**  
   Procedures, targets, and tools for performance, load, and stress testing.
5. **Security and Vulnerability Testing**  
   Penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, and results tracking.
6. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**  
   Planning, coordination, and execution details with stakeholders.
7. **Automated Testing Framework**  
   Automated test frameworks, CI/CD integration, and execution pipelines.
8. **Bug Tracking and Resolution**  
   Tools, triage workflow, metrics for bug closure efficiency.
9. **Clarifications & Refinements Document**
   A dedicated, continually updated clarificationsAndRefinements.md file that stores all refinements from this template's execution.
   Do not modify existing entries — only append new ones.
   Each refinement must be tied to a specific FEATURE and categorized under Frontend, Backend, or DB.
   Refinements must be specific and detailed, not general.
   This file ensures accuracy and consistency for future templates or development steps.
10. **Validation & Approval Confirmation**  
    Confirmation that all test phases passed, coverage targets met, TDD validated, and performance benchmarks achieved.

## TDD Validation

Prompt: "Explain how test-first development will be validated and audited, including compliance with the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for each feature or component."

## Test Coverage and Quality Metrics

Prompt: "Define target test coverage percentages, test effectiveness metrics, and how they will be measured, including TDD adherence."

## Unit, Integration, and System Testing

Prompt: "Describe unit, integration, and system testing approaches, tools, and scope for each level."

## Performance and Load Testing

Prompt: "Outline performance, load, and stress testing procedures, targets, and tools."

## Security and Vulnerability Testing

Prompt: "Describe security testing, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment processes."

## User Acceptance Testing

Prompt: "Explain how UAT will be planned, coordinated, and executed with stakeholder involvement."

## Automated Testing Framework

Prompt: "List the automated testing frameworks and continuous testing integrations planned, including CI/CD integration."

## Bug Tracking and Resolution

Prompt: "Specify bug tracking tools, triage process, resolution workflow, and metrics for bug closure efficiency."

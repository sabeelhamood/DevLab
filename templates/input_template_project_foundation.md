## Instruction

- Collect all relevant information to provide a structured description of the project foundation.
- Ensure clarity, completeness, and traceability for subsequent phases.
- Before executing this template, read the latest clarificationsAndRefinements.md and follow all existing clarifications and refinements. Implement the template tasks accordingly. After completion, append any new clarifications or refinements generated here to the same file. Do not modify or delete existing content; only add new entries. This keeps the file up-to-date for subsequent templates.
- If there is anything unclear and you want more details, ask me questions so I can help you and clarify things for you.

## Output:

1. **Project Vision & Objectives**  
   Concise overview of the project, including mission, primary goals, the problem being solved, and the solution concept.
2. **Scope, Target Audience, and Expected Impact**  
   Description of project boundaries, intended users or beneficiaries, and measurable or qualitative impact.
3. **Requirements Summary**  
   List of key functional and non-functional requirements needed to achieve project objectives.
4. **Unique Approach or Innovation**  
   Summary of differentiators, innovations, or unique approaches that provide value over alternative solutions.
5. **AI/Automation Insights**  
   Observations or validations derived from AI-assisted analysis, including opportunity assessment, strategic alignment verification, and risk considerations.
6. **Validation & Stakeholder Approval**  
   Confirmation that all foundation elements have been reviewed, validated, and approved by relevant stakeholders.
7. **Clarifications & Refinements Document**  
   A dedicated, continually updated clarificationsAndRefinements.md file that stores all refinements from this template's execution.
   Do not modify existing entries — only append new ones.
   Each refinement must be tied to a specific FEATURE and categorized under Frontend, Backend, or DB.
   Refinements must be specific and detailed, not general.
   This file ensures accuracy and consistency for future templates or development steps.

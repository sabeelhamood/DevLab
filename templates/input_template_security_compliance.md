## Instruction

- Define security audit plans, penetration testing, and vulnerability scans.
- Implement data privacy and encryption strategies for data at rest and in transit.
- List relevant compliance frameworks (ISO, SOC, GDPR, HIPAA) and certification steps.
- Design monitoring, alerting, and incident response workflows.
- Identify potential threats and mitigation strategies.
- Specify authentication, authorization, and role-based access control mechanisms.
- Document security procedures and provide training plans.
- Apply automated tools where appropriate for validation and monitoring.
- If there is anything unclear and you want more details, ask me questions so I can help you and clarify things for you.

# Requirements Discovery & Analysis

# CURSOR AI Role Definition

**Prompt for CURSOR AI:**

> YOU ARE A SENIOR BUSINESS & SYSTEM ANALYST.
> Your responsibility is to gather, analyze, validate, and prioritize all functional and non-functional requirements, business rules, compliance obligations, integration needs, UX and accessibility standards, and performance targets.
> Ensure requirements are complete, conflict-free, TDD-ready, and aligned with strategic objectives.

---

## Instruction

- List all functional requirements, features, and expected system behaviors.
- Document non-functional requirements including performance, scalability, security, availability, compliance, and accessibility.
- Capture user stories, epics, and testable acceptance criteria for TDD.
- Identify business rules, constraints, policies, and assumptions.
- Map integration requirements and external dependencies.
- Ensure legal, regulatory, and security compliance requirements are captured.
- Define UX expectations and accessibility standards (WCAG, ADA).
- Specify performance and availability targets, SLAs, and scaling needs.
- Apply AI-assisted validation for completeness, conflict detection, and intelligent prioritization.
- Before executing this template, read the latest clarificationsAndRefinements.md and follow all existing clarifications and refinements. Implement the template tasks accordingly. After completion, append any new clarifications or refinements generated here to the same file. Do not modify or delete existing content; only add new entries. This keeps the file up-to-date for subsequent templates.
- If there is anything unclear and you want more details, ask me questions so I can help you and clarify things for you.

## Output :

1. **Functional & Non-Functional Requirements**  
   Comprehensive list of system features, behaviors, and quality attributes, grouped by priority or user story
2. **User Stories, Epics & Acceptance Criteria**  
   Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria, designed to be TDD-ready.
3. **Business Rules & Constraints**  
   Complete documentation of rules, policies, assumptions, and constraints.
4. **Integration Requirements & Dependencies**  
   List of external systems, APIs, services, and dependencies with interface specifications.
5. **Compliance, Regulatory & Security Requirements**  
   Legal, regulatory, and security requirements relevant to the project.
6. **UX & Accessibility Standards**  
   Usability targets, UX expectations, and accessibility compliance details.
7. **Performance & Availability Requirements**  
   SLAs, response time targets, uptime expectations, and scalability requirements.
8. **AI/Automation Enhancements**  
   AI-assisted analysis for conflict detection, completeness validation, and intelligent prioritization.
9. **Validation & Approval Confirmation**  
   Confirmation that all requirements are captured, validated, prioritized, and approved by stakeholders.
10. **Clarifications & Refinements Document**
    A dedicated, continually updated clarificationsAndRefinements.md file that stores all refinements from this template's execution.
    Do not modify existing entries — only append new ones.
    Each refinement must be tied to a specific FEATURE and categorized under Frontend, Backend, or DB.
    Refinements must be specific and detailed, not general.
    This file ensures accuracy and consistency for future templates or development steps.

## Functional & Non-Functional Specifications

Prompt: "List all functional requirements, features, and behaviors the system must perform. Also describe all non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, availability, compliance, and accessibility. Group by priority or user story."

## User Stories, Epics, and Acceptance Criteria

Prompt: "Provide detailed user stories and epics. Define acceptance criteria as testable conditions to support Test-Driven Development (TDD)."

## Business Rules and Constraints

Prompt: "Document all business rules, policies, constraints, and assumptions that govern system behavior."

## Integration Requirements and Dependencies

Prompt: "Identify all external systems, APIs, services, and dependencies the system must integrate with, including interface specifications."

## Compliance, Regulatory, and Security Requirements

Prompt: "List all legal, regulatory, data privacy, and security compliance requirements relevant to the project."

## UX and Accessibility Standards

Prompt: "Describe user experience expectations, usability targets, and accessibility standards (WCAG, ADA)."

## Performance and Availability Requirements

Prompt: "Define expected performance targets, SLAs, response times, uptime, and scaling requirements."

## AI/Automation Enhancement

Prompt: "Leverage AI-assisted tools to detect requirement conflicts, validate completeness, and intelligently prioritize requirements."

---

## Validation Checkpoint

Prompt: "Have all functional, non-functional, business, integration, compliance, performance, and UX requirements been captured, validated, prioritized, and approved by stakeholders? and all refinements from this template appended to the clarificationsAndRefinements.md file?"

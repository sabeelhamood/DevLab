  "description": "DevLab is an AI-powered coding practice, assessment, and competition microservice. It generates coding questions, evaluates code solutions, produces test cases, detects AI-generated code (fraud detection), creates AI-vs-learner competitions, and generates interactive HTML components with CodeMirror. DevLab receives and processes requests from multiple microservices through the Coordinator gateway: (1) Content Studio – receives requests to generate coding questions, validate trainer-authored questions, and transform exercises into validated question formats; when Content Studio requests theoretical question generation, the request is forwarded by DevLab to the Assessment Service; (2) Assessment Service – receives forwarded requests for theoretical question generation from DevLab, and sends coding questions to DevLab when requested. ;(3) Learning Analytics - receives pull-based queries for competition performance data and learner analytics; (4) Course Builder Service - receives course completion notifications when a learner completes a specific course, which triggers user profile creation, course completion recording, and automatic AI competition question generation for that learner.",

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Quickest)

npm install -g vercel

# Navigate to project root
cd C:\Users\ThinkPad\Desktop\DevLab

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Deploy via Git Push (Automatic)

If your GitHub repo is connected to Vercel:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd C:\Users\ThinkPad\Desktop\DevLab

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Update SimpleQuestionPage UI - deploy changes"

# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically detect the push and deploy the changes.

### Option 3: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click **Deployments** tab
4. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
5. Or go to **Settings** → **Deploy Hooks** to create a webhook

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

After deployment, verify the changes are live:

1. **Open your Vercel URL** (e.g., `https://dev-lab-phi.vercel.app`)
2. **Navigate to the homepage** - this loads SimpleQuestionPage
3. **Check the updated UI elements**:
   - Question display formatting
   - Test cases layout
   - Sandbox editor
   - Hints panel
   - Solution panel
   - Submission modal

## 🧪 Testing Changes Locally First

# Build the project
npm run build

# Preview the build
npm run preview

# üöÄ Automatic Deployment Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ **Current Status**

**Available GitHub Secrets:**
- ‚úÖ `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID` - Configured
- ‚úÖ `RAILWAY_TOKEN` - Configured  
- ‚úÖ `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Configured
- ‚úÖ `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Configured

**Missing GitHub Secrets (Optional but Recommended):**
- ‚ùå `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` - For specific service deployment
- ‚ùå `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - For organization-scoped deployment
- ‚ùå `GEMINI_API_KEY` - For Railway environment (if not already set in Railway)

## üéØ **Deployment Configuration**

### **Backend (Railway)**
- **Root Directory**: `backend/` ‚úÖ
- **Build Command**: `cd backend && npm run build` ‚úÖ
- **Start Command**: `npm start` (runs `node src/app.js`) ‚úÖ
- **Environment Variables**: `GEMINI_API_KEY` (already set in Railway) ‚úÖ
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint ‚úÖ

### **Frontend (Vercel)**
- **Root Directory**: `frontend/` ‚úÖ
- **Build Command**: `cd frontend && npm run build` ‚úÖ
- **Output Directory**: `frontend/dist` ‚úÖ
- **SPA Routing**: Configured with rewrites ‚úÖ
- **CORS Headers**: Configured for API communication ‚úÖ

## üîß **Missing Components Setup**

### **1. Railway Service ID (Optional)**

**Why needed:** For deploying to a specific service in your Railway project.

**How to get it:**
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click on your backend service
4. Go to Settings ‚Üí General
5. Copy the "Service ID"

**How to add:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Add new secret: `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID`
4. Paste the Service ID

**Fallback:** The workflow will attempt to deploy to the default service if not provided.

### **2. Vercel Organization ID (Optional)**

**Why needed:** For organization-scoped deployments.

**How to get it:**
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí General
3. Copy the "Team ID" (this is your ORG_ID)

**How to add:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Add new secret: `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
4. Paste the Team ID

**Fallback:** The workflow will deploy using your personal scope if not provided.

### **3. Gemini API Key (Optional)**

**Why needed:** If you want to manage the API key through GitHub secrets instead of Railway directly.

**How to add:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Add new secret: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
4. Paste your Gemini API key

**Fallback:** The workflow will use the existing `GEMINI_API_KEY` from Railway environment.

## üöÄ **Testing the Deployment**

### **Test 1: Manual Vercel Deployment**
```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

### **Test 2: Manual Railway Deployment**
```bash
cd backend
railway up
```

### **Test 3: GitHub Actions Workflow**
1. Push any change to the `main` branch
2. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab
3. Watch the "Deploy Fullstack Application" workflow
4. Check the deployment summary

## üìä **Expected Deployment Behavior**

### **On Push to Main:**
1. **Frontend Deployment (Vercel)**:
   - Validates `VERCEL_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - Installs Vercel CLI
   - Builds frontend with `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Deploys to Vercel production
   - Shows deployment URL

2. **Backend Deployment (Railway)**:
   - Validates `RAILWAY_TOKEN` and `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`
   - Installs Railway CLI
   - Sets environment variables (NODE_ENV, PORT)
   - Builds backend with `cd backend && npm run build`
   - Starts backend with `npm start`
   - Deploys to Railway production
   - Shows deployment URL

3. **Deployment Summary**:
   - Shows status of both deployments
   - Displays URLs for both services
   - Reports any failures with detailed logs

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Vercel 404 Error**:
   - Check `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` is correct
   - Verify project exists in Vercel dashboard
   - Add `VERCEL_ORG_ID` if using organization

2. **Railway Build Failure**:
   - Ensure `backend/package.json` has `build` script
   - Check Railway project has correct root directory
   - Add `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID` for specific service

3. **Missing Secrets**:
   - Verify all required secrets are set
   - Check secret names match exactly
   - Ensure secrets have correct values

### **Debug Commands:**

```bash
# Check Vercel deployment
vercel ls

# Check Railway deployment  
railway status

# View Railway logs
railway logs

# Test Railway connection
railway whoami
```

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

After setup, pushing to `main` should:
- ‚úÖ Build and deploy frontend to Vercel
- ‚úÖ Build and deploy backend to Railway  
- ‚úÖ Use existing `GEMINI_API_KEY` from Railway
- ‚úÖ Show deployment URLs in GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ Keep backend running as Node.js server
- ‚úÖ Handle missing optional secrets gracefully

## üéâ **Ready to Deploy!**

Your automatic deployment system is now configured and ready to use. The workflow will handle missing optional secrets gracefully and provide detailed logging for troubleshooting.

**Next Steps:**
1. Add optional secrets if desired (see above)
2. Push a change to `main` to test the deployment
3. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow
4. Check both Vercel and Railway dashboards for deployment status

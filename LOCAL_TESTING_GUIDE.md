# Local Testing Guide for 2-Player Anonymous Competition Feature

## 🎯 Overview

This guide helps you test the complete 2-player anonymous competition feature locally, exactly as it works in the deployed version, without affecting production.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup-local-testing.sh    # Linux/Mac
# or
setup-local-testing.bat     # Windows
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Create Environment Files**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cp backend/env.local.example backend/.env.local
   
   # Frontend  
   cp frontend/env.local.example frontend/.env.local
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && npm install
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Edit `backend/.env.local` with your API keys (optional for testing)
   - `frontend/.env.local` is already configured for local testing

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

### Terminal 1: Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Backend will run on: `http://localhost:3001`

### Terminal 2: Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Frontend will run on: `http://localhost:5173`

## 🧪 Testing the Competition Feature

### 1. Access the Application
- Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
- You should see the main application interface

### 2. Navigate to Competition Invitation
- Go to: `http://localhost:5173/competition/invitation`
- You should see the invitation interface with available opponents

### 3. Test the Complete Flow

#### Step 1: Accept Invitation
- Click "Challenge" on any available opponent
- This creates a competition with 3 questions

#### Step 2: Competition Questions
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/competition/{id}/question/1`
- Test the timer functionality (10 minutes per question)
- Test the progress bar
- Test sound effects (if enabled)
- Submit an answer or let the timer auto-submit

#### Step 3: Complete All Questions
- Repeat for questions 2 and 3
- Each question has a 10-minute timer
- Progress bar shows completion status

#### Step 4: View Results
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/competition/{id}/results`
- Verify anonymous results (Player A vs Player B)
- Check winner determination
- Test celebration animations

## 🔧 Features to Test

### ✅ Core Functionality
- [ ] Competition invitation system
- [ ] 2-player anonymous matching
- [ ] 3-question competition flow
- [ ] Timer functionality (10 min per question)
- [ ] Auto-submission when time runs out
- [ ] Progress bar with color coding
- [ ] Sound effects (start, countdown, completion)
- [ ] Answer evaluation (mock or real Gemini)
- [ ] Winner determination
- [ ] Anonymous results display

### ✅ UI/UX Elements
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Celebration animations
- [ ] Progress indicators
- [ ] Timer warnings
- [ ] Sound controls

### ✅ Integration Points
- [ ] Backend API endpoints (`/api/competitions/*`)
- [ ] Frontend routing
- [ ] Environment variable configuration
- [ ] Mock data fallbacks
- [ ] Error boundaries

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- **Port 3001 in use**: Change `PORT` in `backend/.env.local`
- **Database connection**: Check Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
- **API key errors**: Mock data will be used automatically

### Frontend Issues
- **Port 5173 in use**: Vite will automatically use the next available port
- **API connection**: Verify `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api` in `.env.local`
- **Component errors**: Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Competition Flow Issues
- **Invitation not loading**: Check backend logs for API errors
- **Timer not working**: Verify JavaScript is enabled and no console errors
- **Sound not playing**: Check browser permissions and sound file paths
- **Results not showing**: Verify competition completion and API responses

## 📊 Mock Data

When API keys are not available, the system uses mock data:

- **Questions**: Pre-defined coding challenges
- **Evaluation**: Random success rate (70%)
- **Results**: Anonymous Player A/B display
- **Timers**: Full functionality with mock submissions

## 🔒 Production Safety

- ✅ No changes to production deployment
- ✅ Local environment isolated
- ✅ Mock data prevents external API calls
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Environment variables separate from production

## 📝 Testing Checklist

### Pre-Testing
- [ ] Environment files created
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Both servers running
- [ ] No console errors

### During Testing
